<h1>Easy Setup Overview</h1>

<p>This document explains the procedures necessary to download and install
   ArchStudio 4.  ArchStudio 4 has three critical components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A Java 2&trade; Standard Edition (J2SE) version 5.0 virtual machine;</li>
  <li>Eclipse version 4.2 or better (Classic version); and</li>
  <li>ArchStudio itself.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you already have Java 5 or Eclipse 4.2 (or better) installed, you
   may safely skip those parts of these instructions as they require
   no special configuration for ArchStudio.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Setting up Java</h2>

<p>ArchStudio 4 (and Eclipse) are Java applications.  ArchStudio 4 is
   written specifically for Java 2 Standard Edition version 5.0
   (aka JDK1.5) or better.  It will not run properly in any previous version of Java.</p>

<p>It is possible that you already have Java 5 installed on your machine.
   To check, start a command-prompt and run:</p>

<p><code>java -version</code></p>

<p>If the version reported is (1.)5.0 or better, skip to the next step.  If
   not, you will need to obtain a version of Java for your target
   environment.  In general, you can obtain such a release free of
   charge from Sun Microsystems at the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java SE site</a>.
   This is generally the path to pursue if you are running on Windows or Solaris.
   Note that Sun offers many Java 5 packages - nearly any should work,
   although we recommend the Java Development Kit (JDK) package.</p>

<p>MacOS X users can download a Java 5 development kit from
   <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/">Apple's Developer Site</a>.</p>

<p>Linux users will want to investigate how Java is deployed on their
   particular distribution of Linux.  For many years, getting official
   Sun Java implementations on Linux was difficult because Sun's
   Java license was not compatible with those of the various Linux
   distributions, and users had to download and install Java on their
   own. Sun's licensing of Java has recently become much more favorable
   and many distributions are now offering Sun Java through their
   package repositories such as <code>apt</code>.  We
   recommend the use of Sun Java, as other VMs such as kaffe
   may not be compatible with Eclipse and ArchStudio.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Setting up Eclipse</h2>

<p>ArchStudio requires Eclipse 4.2 or better.  If you already have
   Eclipse installed, you may install ArchStudio into your existing
   environment and can skip to the next step.  Alternatively, you can
   simply duplicate your Eclipse directory or download and extract
   another copy to create a copy of Eclipse solely for running ArchStudio.</p>

<p>Download Eclipse 4.2 or better from the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse downloads site</a>.
   Eclipse's site should provide adequate documentation for expanding
   the archive and starting the Eclipse environment.  Start Eclipse.
   It may ask you for a workspace location.  This is the directory where
   Eclipse will store projects, including ArchStudio projects that contain
   xADL files.  You may accept the default or choose a different directory.
   We recommend creating a new directory outside of Eclipse's install
   directory, since this makes it easier to upgrade Eclipse later without
   having to go through extra trouble to migrate your workspace to the new
   version.</p>

<p>Once Eclipse is running, it may show the Welcome view if this is the
   first time it has been run.  Close the Welcome view and the Java
   development perspective should be displayed.
   Once Eclipse is running, you are ready to install ArchStudio.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Installing ArchStudio</h2>

<p>This section will walk you through the install of ArchStudio step-by-step,
   with each step annotated by screenshots.  Note that you must be connected
   to the Internet for this to work.</p>

      That's it.  You can now drag your file from the navigator and drop it

      The easiest editor to get started with is Archipelago, the graphical editor.
