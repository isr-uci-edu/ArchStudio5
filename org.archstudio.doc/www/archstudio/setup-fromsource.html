<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>This document describes how to check out the ArchStudio (and
	constituent) code from the ISR Subversion repository and build
	ArchStudio from source.</p>

<p>
	Casual ArchStudio users or those evaluating the technology should
	probably just <a href="setup-easy.html">download and install the
		latest pre-built release</a>. However, ArchStudio developers - those who
	are interested in developing new ArchStudio components, making changes
	to ArchStudio itself, or those interested in having bleeding-edge
	updates to ArchStudio before they go into official release - should
	check out the ArchStudio source code and build the environment from
	source.
</p>

<h1>The Source Code Environment</h1>

<p>
	ArchStudio and related projects are stored and managed in a <a
		href="https://github.com/">github</a> repository. <a
		href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is an open-source configuration
	management system. It is increasingly supported by tools on many
	popular platforms that make it easy to work with and contribute to our
	source code in your favorite development environment.
</p>

<p>
	ArchStudio is built in and for the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>
	development environment. Although you can check out ArchStudio source
	code without using Eclipse, we recommend doing it in Eclipse so you can
	actually build the source.
</p>

<p>
	If you are just interested in browsing the source without checking it
	out, you can <a href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio">browse
		the raw source archive</a>.
</p>

<h1>What You'll Need</h1>

<p>You will need the following installed on your machine:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>(Required)</b> A Java 2 SE, version 5.0 Software
		Development Kit;</li>
	<li><b>(Required)</b> Eclipse 4.2 or better;</li>
	<li><b>(Required)</b> ArchStudio itself; and</li>
	<li><b>(Highly Recommended)</b> The EGit Git client plug-in for
		Eclipse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Java 2 Software Development Kit</h2>

<p>
	At the current time, ArchStudio is developed on Java 2 Standard
	Edition, version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0). You can download the runtime
	environment or development toolkit from: <a
		href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html</a>
	More detailed instructions are included on the <a
		href="setup-easy.html">easy setup</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Eclipse 4.2 or Better</h2>

<p>
	You will also need to download Eclipse 4.2 or better, and install it on
	your machine. Downloads and installation instructions are available at
	<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org/</a>. If you
	already have Eclipse, you can also download and extract a second copy
	in a separate directory solely for ArchStudio if you so desire. More
	detailed instructions are included on the <a href="setup-easy.html">easy
		setup</a> page.
</p>


<h2>ArchStudio Itself</h2>

<p>
	You will also need to install ArchStudio itself in order to build
	ArchStudio. Follow the <a href="setup-easy.html" />instructions to
	install ArchStudio</a> and install it into your Eclipse environment. More
	detailed instructions are included on the <a href="setup-easy.html">easy
		setup</a> page.
</p>

<h2>EGit Client</h2>

<p>
	A Git client is required to checkout ArchStudio source code. EGit will
	allow you to check out the ArchStudio source code directly into your
	Eclipse workspace as a set of projects. Installation of EGit is similar
	to the installation of ArchStudio, above. However, use the <a
		href="http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/">updatesite for EGit</a>.
	Alternatively, you may use another Git client, but the instructions
	here will be for EGit.
</p>

<h1>Checking Out for the First Time</h1>

<p>Once you have the tools above installed and running, you can
	check out the ArchStudio source code. ArchStudio is composed of a
	number of different sub-projects, each of which contributes a part to
	the environment.</p>

<p>To check out the code perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open up the Git perspective by going to Window | Open
		Perspective | Other ... | Select "Git Repository Exploring" | Hit OK</li>
	<li>Select "Clone a Git Repository"</li>
	<li>In the dialog box that pops up, enter the following for the
		URI <a href="https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio.git">https://github.com/isr-uci-edu/ArchStudio.git</a>
	</li>
	<li>Click Next</li>
	<li>Click Next again</li>
	<li>Select "Import all existing projects after clone finishes"</li>
	<li>Click Finish (... wait several minutes for the checkout to
		complete)</li>
	<li>Return to the Plugin perspective by going to Window | Open
		Perspective | Other ... | Select "Plug-in Development" | Hit OK.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Common Problems</h1>

<p>After completing the steps above, you should have the Eclipse
	environment populated with the many plugins used to develop ArchStudio
	and all plugins should compile without any errors.</p>

<p>At times Eclipse will report compile errors even though none
	really exist and all projects are checked out. To remedy this go to
	Project | Clean ... | Select "Clean all projects" | hit OK. You may
	have to repeat this step twice.</p>

<h1>Running ArchStudio</h1>

<p>From within Eclipse, you can run the version of ArchStudio that
	you checked out using the ArchStudio launch configuration. To do so,
	perform the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go to Run | Debug Configurations...</li>
	<li>Select Eclipse Applications / ArchStudio</li>
	<li>Click Debug</li>
	<li>Click OK on the Validation dialog box</li>
	<li>Select an ArchStudio Workspace location, click OK</li>
</ol>
